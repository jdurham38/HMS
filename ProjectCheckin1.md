**Task Progress Update**





**Completed Items**

Security issue #1 (COMMIT_ID: 72d27b695e155b82832ff6d698db833aaa7fa5fd): Updated all current libraries used to the most updated version.

Security issue #2 (COMMIT_ID: 78f1b7048b0482ceb1763db762b12970326195f3): Added logging in my code to output all login attempts made by patients into a txt file.


**Work Completed**

**Security issue #1:** I went through all the libraries we were using and updated them to the latest versions available. This helps ensure that we're using the most stable and secure versions of the libraries, which in turn helps prevent any potential issues down the road. By keeping our dependencies up-to-date, we can continue to deliver a better product and maintain the trust of our users. It's important to stay current with these updates, so I made sure to go through the process thoroughly and make any necessary adjustments to our code to ensure compatibility.

**Feature request #2:** I recently made some improvements to my code and decided to add a cool new feature: logging all patient login attempts into a text file. With this addition, I can keep track of all login attempts and quickly identify any suspicious activity. The file makes it easy to view and analyze the login attempts, and I'm confident that it will be a valuable tool in keeping my app secure.
