**Work Completed**

**Security issue #1:** I went through all the libraries we were using and updated them to the latest versions available. This helps ensure that we're using the most stable and secure versions of the libraries, which in turn helps prevent any potential issues down the road. By keeping our dependencies up-to-date, we can continue to deliver a better product and maintain the trust of our users. It's important to stay current with these updates, so I made sure to go through the process thoroughly and make any necessary adjustments to our code to ensure compatibility.

**Security issue #2:** I addded a simple plan for internal actor threats.

**Security issue #3:** I added a simple backup plan for an outage of the website or a loss of the github repo.

**Feature request #1:** I recently made some improvements to my code and decided to add a cool new feature: logging all patient login attempts into a text file. With this addition, I can keep track of all login attempts and quickly identify any suspicious activity. The file makes it easy to view and analyze the login attempts, and I'm confident that it will be a valuable tool in keeping my app secure.

**Feature request #2:** I added improvements to the master github repo by making it private and only allowing select users to access and make push requests which ultimately need ot be approved by me. Additionally I added logging for user changes to information or when a user views their information. Finally, I added logging for attempts made to login on all user types.
